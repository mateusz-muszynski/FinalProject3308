# FinalProject3308

Brief Application description:
The product would provide a platform in which users can connect with others who are interested in space and access a platform to see what astronomy events are viewable in their area. It would be useful because people could easily view their locationâ€™s most popular photos and know how and where to look in the sky to see cool space things.
