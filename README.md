# Final Project: CSCI 3308

## Brief Application description:
----
*SkyShare* is a platform that connects space enthusiasts and is dedicated to showcasing the best space photos from all across the country! Upon logging into an account, users can access the Home page, Following page, My Photos page, the Public Map, and NASA photos.

On the Home page, the user can see their two most recently uploaded photos and a slideshow of photos from the other users which they are following. 

On the My Photos page, users can publicly upload their coolest space photos along with the location they were taken. These photos are displayed on this page, too.

On the Following page, users can follow their friends by inputting their usernames and, in turn, see the photos they have posted.

On the Public Map page, there are markers for the 50 US states which display a carousel of photos taken at that state by all users on SkyShare.

On the NASA page, users can view NASAâ€™s photo of the day along with a description of the photo.
